# ZeroNote

ZeroNote is a note-taking web app designed for touch screens with styluses. It doesn't require a download; you can start using it right now [here](https://oscarsaharoy.github.io/zeronote/).
It is meant to be a replacement for the drawing in OneNote but hopefully less buggy.
Draw with one finger/stylus and pan & zoom with two.
